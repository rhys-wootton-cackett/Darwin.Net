<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**Darwin.Net** is a versatile and efficient C# wrapper for the UK's National Rail Darwin OpenLDBWS API, specifically designed to simplify railway data integration tasks. 

Its features include:

- **Asynchronous Requests**: Leverage the power of async/await to make non-blocking requests.
- **HttpClient**: By using HttpClient instead of SOAP/WCF, Darwin.Net benefits from improved performance, better resource management, and modern networking capabilities. HttpClient is lighter, faster, and more flexible than its alternatives, making it the ideal choice for a contemporary C# wrapper.
- **Multi-platform Support**: Harness the cross-platform capabilities of .NET to deploy applications using Darwin.Net on a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Darwin.Net library is self-contained and does not rely on any external packages, making it easy to integrate and maintain in your projects."

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy built, follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

1. Obtain an API key from [National Rail Enquiries](http://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWSRegistration/)
2. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rhys-wootton/Darwin.Net.git
   ```
3. Create an `app.config` file within the Darwin.Net project and add the following
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <configuration>
        <appSettings>
            <add key="DarwinApiKey" value="YOUR_API_KEY" />
            <add key="DarwinUrl" value="https://lite.realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWS/ldb12.asmx"/>
            <add key="DarwinActionNameUrl" value="http://thalesgroup.com/RTTI/2021-11-01/ldb/"/>
            <add key="DarwinTokenTypeUrl" value="http://thalesgroup.com/RTTI/2013-11-28/Token/types"/>
        </appSettings>
    </configuration>
   ```
4. Build  the project

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To get started, this single line of code will give you access to all the requests that Darwin.Net can make:

```c#
Darwin.Net.Darwin darwin = new Darwin.Net.Darwin();
```

From here, you are able to call some of the following requests:

##### Get up to 10 arrivals at a station for the next 90 minutes
```c#
int maxArrivals = 10;
Station station = Station.LondonBridge;
TimeSpan timeWindow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(90);

StationBoard response = await darwin.Requests.GetArrivalBoardAsync(maxArrivals, station, timeWindow);
```

##### Get up to 5 departures at a station within the last hour with specific calling points
```c#
int maxArrivals = 5;
Station station = Station.GlasgowCentral;
TimeSpan timeWindow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(60);
TimeSpan offset = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(-60);

StationBoardWithDetails response = await darwin.Requests.GetDepartureBoardWithDetailsAsync(maxArrivals, station, timeWindow, timeOffset = offset);
```

##### Get the next fastest services from a station to a list of station within the next 30 minutes
```c#
Station station = Station.LondonEuston;
List<Station> stationList = new List<Station>() {
  Station.Coventry,
  Station.WatfordJunction,
  Station.MiltonKeynesCentral
};
TimeSpan timeWindow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);

DeparturesBoardWithDetails response = await darwin.Requests.GetFastestDeparturesWithDetailsAsync(station, stationList, timeWindow);
```

##### Get specific services details
```c#
int maxArrivals = 5;
Station station = Station.GlasgowCentral;
TimeSpan timeWindow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(60);
TimeSpan offset = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(-60);

StationBoard response = await darwin.Requests.GetArrivalBoardAsync(maxArrivals, station, timeWindow, timeOffset = offset);
ServiceDetails service = await darwin.Requests.GetServiceDetailsAsync(response.TrainServices[0].RetailServiceId);
```
